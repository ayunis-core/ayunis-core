# React Frontend Bugbot Policy

- All UI primitives (button, dialog, form, input, card, tabs, badge, etc.) must come from the Ayunis UI component library at `src/shared/ui/shadcn/`. If a PR introduces a new UI element that duplicates or reimplements functionality already provided by an existing component in that directory, flag this as an issue
- Never install third-party UI component libraries (e.g. Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Mantine) when equivalent components exist in `src/shared/ui/shadcn/`. If a new dependency provides UI primitives that overlap with the existing library, flag this as an issue
- Custom components in features, widgets, or pages must compose from the Ayunis UI primitives in `src/shared/ui/shadcn/` rather than building raw HTML with inline Tailwind for common patterns (buttons, inputs, dialogs, cards, etc.). If raw `<button>`, `<input>`, or `<dialog>` elements are used where an Ayunis UI component exists, flag this as an issue
- **CRITICAL**: Files inside `src/shared/ui/shadcn/` must NEVER be modified to accommodate a specific use case or to speed up development. These components are the project's own Ayunis UI library (managed via the `@ayunis` registry in `components.json`) and must remain generic. If a PR changes any file in `src/shared/ui/shadcn/` — whether adding custom logic, altering default styles, changing props, or tweaking behavior for a particular feature — flag this as an issue and request that the change be made through an existing variant or by composing a wrapper component outside the library instead
- Developers must not pass custom Tailwind classes to Ayunis UI components to override their built-in styling. Components should be used as-is with the variants and props they expose. If a PR adds custom classes (via `className`) that override or conflict with the component's own styles, flag this as an issue — the correct approach is to use an existing variant or request a new variant be added to the library
- When styling custom (non-library) components, always use the `cn()` utility from `@/shared/lib/shadcn/utils` to merge class names. If conditional class names are concatenated manually with template literals or string concatenation instead of `cn()`, flag this as an issue
- Ayunis UI components use `data-slot` attributes for identification. If a PR removes or changes existing `data-slot` values, flag this as an issue — it may break styling or testing selectors
