# Reusable Composites

Composite UI components reused across two or more application pages.

Ten widget modules provide shared interactive components: app sidebar with thread navigation and user menu, chat input with voice recording and image support, markdown renderer with syntax-highlighted code blocks, chart visualizations (line, bar, pie), confirmation modal with context provider, and utility widgets for headers, empty states, tooltips, and thread renaming.

The `app-sidebar/` widget is the primary navigation component featuring chat thread listing, logout functionality, subscription status hints, release notes access, and user profile display—powered by dedicated API hooks (`useThreads`, `useLogout`, `useMe`, `useHasActiveSubscription`). The `chat-input/` widget handles message composition with rich features: voice recording via `useVoiceRecording`, file drag-and-drop via `useFileDrop`, image paste support via `useImagePaste`, pending image management, and audio transcription through `useTranscribe`. The `markdown/` widget renders AI responses with a custom `Codeblock` component for syntax highlighting. The `charts/` widget group provides `LineChartWidget`, `BarChartWidget`, and `PieChartWidget` wrapped in `ChartCard` containers with loading and empty states, used in admin usage dashboards. The `confirmation-modal/` widget uses React context (`ConfirmationProvider`) for imperative confirmation dialogs via `useConfirmation`. Supporting widgets include `content-area-header/`, `empty-state/`, `tooltip-if/` (conditional tooltips), `agent-activity-hint/`, and `rename-thread-dialog/`.
