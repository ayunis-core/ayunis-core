# Cross-Cutting Logic

Self-contained business logic modules shared across multiple pages and widgets.

Four feature modules and several standalone hooks provide cross-cutting concerns: theme management (dark/light mode persistence), language switching (German/English via i18next), model/provider configuration with provider icon utilities, and usage analytics data hooks for statistics, charts, and distribution metrics.

The `theme/` feature manages dark/light mode with localStorage persistence through `useTheme`, `setTheme`, and `getTheme` utilities. The `language/` feature wraps i18next language switching in a `useLanguage` hook. The `models/` feature provides `useModelsWithConfig` and `useProviders` hooks for fetching AI model configurations, plus provider constants and icon utilities for Ollama, Mistral, Anthropic, and OpenAI. The `usage/` feature contains analytics hooks (`useUsageStats`, `useUserUsage`, `useProviderUsage`, `useProviderUsageChart`, `useModelDistribution`, `useUsageConfig`) powering admin dashboard charts. Standalone hooks at the feature root include `useAgents` for agent listing, `useDeleteThread` and `useRenameThread` for thread management, `useAutoScroll` for chat scrolling behavior, `useKeyboardShortcut` for hotkey bindings, `usePermittedModels` for org-scoped model access, `useReleaseNotes` for changelog display, `useRedirectNotification` for post-navigation toasts, and `useGtm` for Google Tag Manager integration.
