# Route Modules

Page components composing widgets and features for each application route.

Fifteen page module groups handle authentication, chat conversations, agent management, prompt libraries, knowledge base management, skill management, user settings, organization admin settings, and super-admin platform management. Each page follows a consistent internal structure with api/, ui/, and model/ subdirectories separating data hooks, components, and types.

The `auth/` group contains six flows: login, register, email confirmation, password forgot/reset, and invite acceptance. The `chat/` and `new-chat/` pages manage AI conversation interfaces with message streaming, agent selection, and knowledge base attachment (`useKnowledgeBaseAttachment` hook for adding/removing KBs on existing threads, plus pending-KB context state for new threads). The `chats/` page lists conversation threads. The `agents/` and `agent/` pages handle AI assistant browsing and detailed configuration. The `prompts/` page provides prompt library management. The `knowledge-bases/` page lists knowledge bases with creation and deletion, while `knowledge-base/` provides the detail view for a single knowledge base including document upload, removal, property editing, and sharing management via a tabbed interface (config/share tabs). Shared knowledge bases display a "Shared" badge and are rendered in read-only mode, disabling property editing and document management. The share tab integrates the `SharesTab` widget for organization and team-level sharing controls. The `skills/` page lists available skills, and `skill/` shows skill details. The `install/` page handles app installation flows. User `settings/` includes account, general preferences, and `chat-settings/` for per-user AI conversation configuration (custom system prompts). The `admin-settings/` group covers organization administration: model configuration, MCP integrations, team/user management, billing, and usage analytics. The `super-admin-settings/` group provides platform-wide management for the models catalog and organization oversight. Each page uses the hooks pattern—one custom hook per operation (create, update, delete)—encapsulating TanStack Query mutations with toast notifications and cache invalidation.
