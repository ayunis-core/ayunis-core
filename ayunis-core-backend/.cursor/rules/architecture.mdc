# Architecture and folder structure

- Domain modules live in the top level src/domain folder, potentially in sub folders if they belong to a parent module
- Modules are coded in hexagonal style
- Each module has the following folder structure
  - application
    - errors
    - use cases
      - <use-case>
        - command / query
        - use case
        - test
  - domain
  - infrastructure
    - persistence
      - schema
      - mappers
      - adapter files for db repository
  - presenters
    - https
      - dtos
      - mappers
      - controller file for http endpoints
  - module file
- All interfaces are represented through classes (ports through abstract classes) if possible
- Configuration is stored under /src/config
- The config module is global, configurations need to be only added to the app.module living in /src/app/app.module
- The ports for the infrastructure layer should use domain objects as much as possible for input and output
