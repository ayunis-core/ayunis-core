User Authentication
Handles login, registration, JWT tokens, and session management.

Manages user authentication flows including login with email/password, new user registration, JWT access/refresh token issuance, and current user retrieval. Uses Passport strategies (local and JWT) with guards protecting routes globally.

This module is the entry point for all identity verification in Ayunis. Key entities include `AuthTokens` (access/refresh token pairs) and `ActiveUser` (authenticated session representation with role, org, and email verification status). Main use cases are login (credential validation and token generation), register-user (account creation with org provisioning), refresh-token (session extension), and get-current-user (profile retrieval). It integrates with the **users** module for credential storage and lookup, **hashing** for password verification, **orgs** for organization creation during registration, and **authorization** for role-based guard enforcement. The `UserContextInterceptor` populates `ContextService` with the authenticated user's ID and org ID for downstream use cases. A global `JwtAuthGuard` secures all routes by default unless explicitly marked `@Public()`.
