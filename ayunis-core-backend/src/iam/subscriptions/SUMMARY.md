Subscription Billing
Manages organization subscriptions, billing info, seats, and cancellations.

Handles the complete subscription lifecycle for organizations including creation, seat management, billing information, pricing, cancellation, and reactivation. Supports monthly and yearly renewal cycles with per-seat pricing.

This module manages commercial access to Ayunis. Key entities are `Subscription` (org-scoped, with seat count, per-seat price, renewal cycle, cancellation status, and cycle anchor date) and `SubscriptionBillingInfo` (company name, address, VAT number). The `RenewalCycle` enum supports monthly and yearly billing. Main use cases include `CreateSubscriptionUseCase`, `CancelSubscriptionUseCase`, `UncancelSubscriptionUseCase` (reactivation before period ends), `UpdateSeatsUseCase` (adjust licensed user count), `UpdateBillingInfoUseCase`, `GetActiveSubscriptionUseCase`, `HasActiveSubscriptionUseCase`, and `GetCurrentPriceUseCase`. Utility functions handle cycle date calculation and active-status determination. It integrates with **orgs** (each subscription belongs to one org), **authorization** via the `SubscriptionGuard` (gates features behind active subscriptions), **quotas** (subscription tier affects limits), and **trials** (organizations transition from trial to paid). The HTTP layer includes both user-facing and super-admin controllers.
