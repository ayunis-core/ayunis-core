# ✨ Make It Nice (AI Command)

## 🧠 Command
Review and improve the current file or code selection to make it cleaner, simpler, and easier to maintain — without changing its logic or behavior.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Eliminate **deeply nested code** — prefer early returns, helper functions, and clear structure.
- Keep **functions and methods small** — each should do one thing well.
- Apply **clean code principles**:
  - Meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
  - Avoid duplication (DRY principle).
  - Maintain consistent formatting and indentation.
  - Use clear control flow (no complex nesting or hard-to-follow logic).
  - Add minimal comments only where needed for clarity.
- Follow **SOLID**, **KISS**, and **single-responsibility** principles where appropriate.
- Do **not** alter functionality — only refactor for clarity, readability, and maintainability.

---

## ✅ Expected Output

- Refactored code that is simpler, flatter, and easier to read.
- Functions and methods are short and focused.
- No unnecessary nesting, repetition, or complexity.
- Consistent style and naming conventions.

## ⚙️ Input
Use the **current file or code selection** as the input context.

✨ *Goal: Make the code elegant, easy to follow, and maintainable — clean, concise, and professional.*
